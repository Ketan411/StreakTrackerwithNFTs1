## **1. Title**  
**StreakTracker: A Blockchain-Based Streak Tracking System**  

## **2. Description**  
StreakTracker is a decentralized streak tracking system built on the Aptos blockchain. Users can log daily activities, maintain streaks, and claim rewards upon achieving milestone streaks. This system ensures transparency, immutability, and fairness while tracking user engagement.  

## **3. Vision of the Project**

By leveraging blockchain technology, the project aims to eliminate fraudulent claims and ensure data integrity.  

## **4. Future Scope**

- **Community Leaderboard:** A ranking system to encourage competition and engagement.  
- **DApp Development:** A user-friendly web or mobile app for seamless tracking.
