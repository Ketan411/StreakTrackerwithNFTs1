## **1. Title**  
**StreakTracker: A Blockchain-Based Streak Tracking System**  

## **2. Description**  
StreakTracker is a decentralized streak tracking system built on the Aptos blockchain. Users can log daily activities, maintain streaks, and claim rewards upon achieving milestone streaks. This system ensures transparency, immutability, and fairness while tracking user engagement.

By leveraging blockchain technology, the project aims to eliminate fraudulent claims and ensure data integrity.
